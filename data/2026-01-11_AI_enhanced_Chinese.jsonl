However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u83b7\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba9AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d4b\u91cf\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d4b\u91cf\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65b0\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u5148\u524d\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u9884\u5148\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56e0\u5b50\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u83b7\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees.

Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements. Our results provide controlled quantitative evidence for intuitions about multi-agent coordination and MoE scaling, while highlighting the dependence of multi-agent benefits on base model capability.

We propose RLMIL-DAT, a multilingual extension of the reinforced multiple instance learning framework that combines reinforcement learning based instance selection with domain adversarial training to encourage language invariant utterance representations. We evaluate the approach on a five language Twitter corpus in a few shot setting and on a VoxCeleb2 derived corpus covering forty languages in a zero shot setting for gender and age prediction. Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages.
