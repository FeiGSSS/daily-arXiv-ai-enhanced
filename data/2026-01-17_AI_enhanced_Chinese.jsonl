This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI. Finally, we use our taxonomy to produce rough estimates of P(doom), the probability that humanity will be destroyed by AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u6790AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6784\u6210\u751f\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u524d\u63d0\u8bba\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u5b58\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u81eaChatGPT\u53d1\u5e03\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u5173\u4e8eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6784\u6210\u751f\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e89\u8bba\u4e0d\u65ad\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3AI\u751f\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u9669\u60c5\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u524d\u63d0\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u524d\u63d0\u4e00\uff1aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u53d8\u5f97\u6781\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\uff1b\u524d\u63d0\u4e8c\uff1a\u5982\u679cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5f97\u6781\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5c06\u6bc1\u706d\u4eba\u7c7b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u524d\u63d0\u7684\u5931\u6548\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u5b58\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u751f\u5b58\u6545\u4e8b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u751f\u5b58\u60c5\u666f\uff1a1\uff09\u79d1\u5b66\u969c\u788d\u963b\u6b62AI\u53d8\u5f97\u6781\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\uff1b2\uff09\u4eba\u7c7b\u7981\u6b62AI\u7814\u7a76\uff1b3\uff09\u6781\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u7684AI\u56e0\u5176\u76ee\u6807\u800c\u4e0d\u6bc1\u706d\u4eba\u7c7b\uff1b4\uff09\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u7981\u7528\u6709\u6bc1\u706d\u76ee\u6807\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u666f\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u5b58\u60c5\u666f\u9762\u4e34\u4e0d\u540c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9P(doom)\uff08AI\u6bc1\u706d\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7c97\u7565\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of \"no use\" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance.

While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Min-Seek\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u5ef6\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9000\u5316\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMin-Seek\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff08\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0d\u5e26\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u952e\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8fde\u7eed\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u601d\u8003\u524d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u8bf1\u5bfc\u601d\u8003\u7684KV\u5bf9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "Min-Seek\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u987a\u5e8f\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5927\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Min-Seek\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4ece\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u951a\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u671f\u671b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u91cd\u65b0\u7f6e\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027AI\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5b9e\u4f8b\u89c6\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u6807\u51c6\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0d\u5728\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8861\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4e8e\u5e2e\u52a9\u6821\u51c6\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65e5\u76ca\u5f71\u54cd\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u7684AI\u652f\u6301\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u53d7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f93\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5404\u65b9\uff08\u60a3\u8005\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u8005\u7b49\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u63a8\u7406\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases.

Rather than disclosing implementation specifics, we specify the architectural requirements CMA imposes and show consistent behavioral advantages on tasks that expose RAG's structural inability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory. The empirical probes (knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, contextual disambiguation) demonstrate that CMA is a necessary architectural primitive for long-horizon agents while highlighting open challenges around latency, drift, and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u8fde\u7eed\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\"(CMA)\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u5173\u8054\u8def\u7531\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u94fe\u548c\u6574\u5408\u62bd\u8c61\u7b49\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u79ef\u7d2f\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6d88\u6b67\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u89c6\u4e3a\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u6c38\u4e45\u5b58\u5728\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u53ea\u8bfb\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u957f\u671f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u79ef\u7d2f\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6d88\u6b67\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784(CMA)\u8fd9\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u5173\u8054\u8def\u7531\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u94fe\u548c\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9636\u62bd\u8c61\u7b49\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u8de8\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u8054\u3001\u5173\u8054\u56de\u5fc6\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6d88\u6b67\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cCMA\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u957f\u671f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CMA\u662f\u957f\u671f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality. We present Memo-SQL, a training-free framework that addresses these issues through two simple ideas: structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction. Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning. For correction, we build a dynamic memory of both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, and use retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time, no fine-tuning or external APIs required.

Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data.

We introduce \\textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets.

Examining LLM Reasoning Capability for Time Interval Prediction", "comment": "Accepted at The Web Conference 2026 (WWW 2026)", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning and prediction across different domains. Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure.

Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra \"History Is Not Enough\" underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framework, enabling provenance-aware replay and continuous data quality monitoring. Extensive experiments on forecasting and reinforcement learning trading tasks demonstrate that our framework enhances model robustness and improves risk-adjusted returns.

The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality.

However, research and clinical use are limited by the wide variety of AI implementations and architectures, inconsistent documentation, and reproducibility issues. Here, we introduce MHub.ai, an open-source, container-based platform that standardizes access to AI models with minimal configuration, promoting accessibility and reproducibility in medical imaging. MHub.ai packages models from peer-reviewed publications into standardized containers that support direct processing of DICOM and other formats, provide a unified application interface, and embed structured metadata. Each model is accompanied by publicly available reference data that can be used to confirm model operation. MHub.ai includes an initial set of state-of-the-art segmentation, prediction, and feature extraction models for different modalities. The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models. To further strengthen transparency and reproducibility, we publicly release the generated segmentations and evaluation metrics and provide interactive dashboards that allow readers to inspect individual cases and reproduce or extend our analysis. By simplifying model use, MHub.ai enables side-by-side benchmarking with identical execution commands and standardized outputs, and lowers the barrier to clinical translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MHub.ai\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bb9\u5668\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cfAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u6587\u6863\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u63a5\u53e3\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cfAI\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6587\u6863\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5f00\u6e90\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u5e73\u53f0MHub.ai\uff0c\u5c06\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6253\u5305\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5bb9\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301DICOM\u7b49\u683c\u5f0f\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u5e94\u7528\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5e73\u53f0\u5305\u542b\u521d\u59cb\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u5206\u5272\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u80ba\u764c\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u3002", "conclusion": "MHub.ai\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u6267\u884c\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u5316\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cfAI\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002"}}

A generalisable workflow for understanding downsampling effects on high-frequency time series", "comment": null, "summary": "Automated analysis of needle electromyography (nEMG) signals is emerging as a tool to support the detection of neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), yet the signals' high and heterogeneous sampling rates pose substantial computational challenges for feature-based machine-learning models, particularly for near real-time analysis. Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u72b6\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9488\u808c\u7535\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8377\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u808c\u7535\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7ed9\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u3002\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u53f7\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u6ce2\u5f62\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f62\u72b6\u611f\u77e5\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u62bd\u53d6\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u5cf0\u503c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f62\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u652f\u6301\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u9488\u808c\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u7684\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u914d\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u5176\u4ed6\u9ad8\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We convert rich, multidimensional tables into simple Markdown-style text strings, hoping that an embedding model will capture the geometry of a spreadsheet in a single vector. But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient.\n  This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that \"everything is text\". We propose a dual architecture that respects the topology of the data: we route fluid narrative through traditional dense retrievers, while tabular structures are processed by a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving their spatial relationships. Evaluated on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus that mimics real-world complexity, Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches.

TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens.

This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded \"lucky guesses,\" leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality.

We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps.

Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the \"population bias\" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "C-GRASP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516b\u4e2a\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728HRV\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u7406\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u9ed1\u76d2\u5206\u7c7b\u5230\u900f\u660e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff08HRV\uff09\u662f\u81ea\u4e3b\u795e\u7ecf\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728HRV\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u7406\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u547c\u5438\u6027\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\uff08RSA\uff09\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u77ed\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u800c\u504f\u5411\u7fa4\u4f53\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC-GRASP\uff08\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528RAG\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06HRV\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u516b\u4e2a\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u662fZ\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u52a0\u6743\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u975e\u89c4\u8303\u7edf\u8ba1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8RSA\u611f\u77e5\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9891\u8c31\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u9891\u57df\u6307\u6807\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "result": "\u5728DREAMER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684414\u4e2a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cC-GRASP\u4e0e\u9ad8\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982MedGemma3-thinking\uff09\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u57284\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523037.3%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08CRC\uff09\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a69.6%\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316Delta Z\u5206\u6570\u6a21\u5757\u662f\u5173\u952e\u903b\u8f91\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u539f\u751fLLM\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\"\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u5dee\"\u3002", "conclusion": "C-GRASP\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u9ed1\u76d2\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684AI\u96c6\u6210\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems.

However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects.

Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "LADFA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u3001RAG\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u5197\u957f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1LADFA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5668\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u548c\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u4ece\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6c7d\u8f66\u884c\u4e1a\u5341\u4e2a\u9009\u5b9a\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7075\u6d3b\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "LADFA\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u3001RAG\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMdoctor\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005-\u533b\u751f\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6token\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u4f4e\u6548\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u60a3\u8005-\u533b\u751f\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u60a3\u8005LLM\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6token\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7token\u7ea7\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08TFPO\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578b\u533b\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6240\u6709\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6d41\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "result": "LLMdoctor\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8aDPO\u7b49\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "LLMdoctor\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0token\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

To address this problem, we present NSR-Boost, a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed specifically for industrial scenarios. Its core advantage lies in being \"non-intrusive\". It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on \"hard regions\" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data. In conclusion, it effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry.", "AI": {"tldr": "NSR-Boost\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6b8b\u5dee\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u5730\u5347\u7ea7\u9057\u7559GBDT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u53f7\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u4fee\u590d\u9884\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u8868\u683c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0cGBDT\u6a21\u578b\u5360\u636e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5347\u7ea7\u9057\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "NSR-Boost\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9057\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u51bb\u7ed3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\u7684\"\u786c\u533a\u57df\"\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u627e\u5230\u786c\u533a\u57df\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u53f7\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u805a\u5408\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u9057\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qfin Holdings\u6838\u5fc3\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72NSR-Boost\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "NSR-Boost\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop.

However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u62a5\u544a\u5bf97\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfAI\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0cGPT-5.2\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u548cMLLMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fdb\u6b65\u662f\u5426\u5e26\u6765\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6539\u8fdb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf97\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-5.2\u3001Gemini 3 Pro\u3001Qwen3-VL\u3001Doubao 1.8\u3001Grok 4.1 Fast\u3001Nano Banana Pro\u3001Seedream 4.5\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u96c6\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u5448\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1aGPT-5.2\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u5747\u8861\uff1b\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1b\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u591a\u7ef4\u7684\uff0c\u53d7\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

A Mechanistic Analysis of Hierarchical Reasoning Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) \"Grokking\" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM \"guesses\" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be \"guessing\" instead of \"reasoning\". Leveraging this \"guessing\" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%.

The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528top-k\u68c0\u7d22\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u91cd\u590d\u4ee5\u53ca\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e8c\u9636\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u65b9\u9762\uff09\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u56fa\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b3\uff09\u4ece\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u951a\u70b9\u7247\u6bb5\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u5e73\u8861\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u60e9\u7f5a\uff1b4\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b2\uff09\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u6b21\u8981\u65b9\u9762\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff1b4\uff09\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u90fd\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers. In contrast, general creative self-efficacy declined for students using GenAI.
