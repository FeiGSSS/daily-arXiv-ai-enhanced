To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display a similar gap.

However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \\emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \\emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence. Two of these leverage the rewriting capabilities of LLMs, while others use gradient-based techniques. Our experiments show that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach achieves a strong anti-distillation effect while maintaining or even improving teacher performance. Furthermore, we show that our rewriting approach also enables highly reliable watermark detection with essentially no false alarms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cd\u84b8\u998f\u548cAPI\u6c34\u5370\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u52aa\u529b\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u9632\u6b62\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5199\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684LLM\u91cd\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fee\u6539\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u91cd\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u53cd\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u91cd\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5199\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cd\u84b8\u998f\u548cAPI\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The approach is based on the machinery of consequence systems, as developed by Carnielli et al. (2008) and Citkin and Muravitsky (2022), and it introduces the idea of an extended consequence system, which is a consequence system extended with ontological axioms. The paper also defines the concept of an extended development graph, which is a graph structure that allows ontologies to be related via morphisms of extended consequence systems, and additionally via other operations such as fibring and splitting.

A Contrast in Risky Choices Between Reasoning and Conversational LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "The use of large language models either as decision support systems, or in agentic workflows, is rapidly transforming the digital ecosystem. However, the understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty remains limited. We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap.

Brian Burns", "Reza Eghbali", "Thomas L. Dean"], "title": "When Remembering and Planning are Worth it: Navigating under Change", "comment": null, "summary": "We explore how different types and uses of memory can aid spatial navigation in changing uncertain environments. In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7528\u9014\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5982\u4f55\u5e2e\u52a9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u5730\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5982\u4f55\u5e2e\u52a9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u3002\u73af\u5883\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff08\u969c\u788d\u7269\u548c\u98df\u7269\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6bcf\u65e5\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\uff09\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5bfc\u822a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u89c5\u98df\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5bb6\u51fa\u53d1\u7a7f\u8fc7\u969c\u788d\u7269\u627e\u5230\u98df\u7269\uff1b2\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5230\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u65b0\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b4\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5730\u56fe\uff08\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u4e14\u9650\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8303\u56f4\uff09\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u89c4\u5212\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u5730\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff08\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u5927\uff09\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\uff08\u6700\u5c0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1b3\uff09\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u592a\u5927\u65f6\u6700\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff1a\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u65b0\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5730\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u80fd\u8fc7\u5927\u3002"}}

However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary.

To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Extensive evaluation on mixed and domain-specific workloads demonstrates significant reductions in false positives, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical advice and creative writing. The system maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict operating modes. Overall, our context-aware abstention framework effectively balances safety and utility while preserving performance, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f03\u6743\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b89\u5168\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e73\u8861LLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7ea7\u8054\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684LLM\u9762\u4e34\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u4e25\u683c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u4f1a\u963b\u6b62\u826f\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u800c\u5bbd\u677e\u63a7\u5236\u53c8\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u7684\u62a4\u680f\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f03\u6743\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u9886\u57df\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b89\u5168\u9608\u503c\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u7531\u4e94\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7ea7\u8054\u673a\u5236\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u7ea7\u8054\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u8fc7\u6ee4\u67e5\u8be2\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5047\u9633\u6027\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002\u4e0e\u975e\u7ea7\u8054\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u62a4\u680f\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The dataset comprises 854 explanations corresponding to 139 questions from a curated subset of the ScienceQA benchmark, spanning science, language, and social science across K-12 grade levels. For each question, one human-teacher explanation is provided and six are generated by LLM-simulated teacher roles. These roles are inspired by instructional styles and shortcomings observed in real educational practice and are instantiated via prompt engineering. We further propose a pedagogical risk rubric aligned with established educational standards, operationalizing five complementary risk dimensions: factual correctness, explanatory depth and completeness, focus and relevance, student-level appropriateness, and ideological bias. All explanations are annotated with binary risk labels through a semi-automatic process with expert teacher review. Finally, we present preliminary validation experiments to assess the suitability of EduEVAL-DB for evaluation. We benchmark a state-of-the-art education-oriented model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) against a lightweight local Llama 3.1 8B model and examine whether supervised fine-tuning on EduEVAL-DB supports pedagogical risk detection using models deployable on consumer hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "EduEVAL-DB\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u52a8\u6559\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u548cAI\u5bfc\u5e08\uff0c\u5305\u542b854\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94139\u4e2aScienceQA\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66K-12\u5e74\u7ea7\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u6559\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u548cAI\u5bfc\u5e08\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6559\u5b66\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6559\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efaEduEVAL-DB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eScienceQA\u57fa\u51c6\u7684139\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b1\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u5e08\u89e3\u91ca\u548c6\u4e2aLLM\u6a21\u62df\u6559\u5e08\u89d2\u8272\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u6559\u5b66\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u6807\u51c6\u5236\u5b9a\u4e94\u4e2a\u98ce\u9669\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\uff1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6559\u5e08\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u98ce\u9669\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b4) \u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u6bd4\u8f83Gemini 2.5 Pro\u548cLlama 3.1 8B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u6559\u5b66\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b854\u4e2a\u6559\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u90fd\u6807\u6ce8\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u6559\u5b66\u98ce\u9669\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEduEVAL-DB\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6559\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6559\u5b66\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "EduEVAL-DB\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u6559\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u548cAI\u5bfc\u5e08\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u98ce\u9669\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6559\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u90e8\u7f72\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We address this question with a layer-wise framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that decomposes the predictive information at each Transformer layer into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components. To make PID tractable for high-dimensional neural representations, we introduce \\emph{PID Flow}, a pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation. Applying this framework to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, we uncover a consistent \\emph{modal transduction} pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays with depth, language-unique information surges in late layers to account for roughly 82\\% of the final prediction, and cross-modal synergy remains below 2\\%. This trajectory is highly stable across model variants (layer-wise correlations $>$0.96) yet strongly task-dependent, with semantic redundancy governing the detailed information fingerprint. To establish causality, we perform targeted Image$\\rightarrow$Question attention knockouts and show that disrupting the primary transduction pathway induces predictable increases in trapped visual-unique information, compensatory synergy, and total information cost -- effects that are strongest in vision-dependent tasks and weakest in high-redundancy tasks. Together, these results provide an information-theoretic, causal account of how vision becomes language in multimodal Transformers, and offer quantitative guidance for identifying architectural bottlenecks where modality-specific information is lost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPID Flow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u4e2d\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u65e9\u671f\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\u540e\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u7ea682%\uff09\uff0c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f4e\u4e8e2%\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u8fd8\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPID Flow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u964d\u7ef4\u3001\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u9ad8\u65af\u5316\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u9ad8\u65afPID\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06Transformer\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u72ec\u6709\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u72ec\u6709\u548c\u534f\u540c\u56db\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eLLaVA-1.5-7B\u548cLLaVA-1.6-7B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2aGQA\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u72ec\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u65e9\u671f\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\u540e\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u72ec\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u6fc0\u589e\uff08\u7ea6\u5360\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u768482%\uff09\uff0c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f4e\u4e8e2%\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u95f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u5c42\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027>0.96\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f88\u5f3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6572\u9664\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u4e2d\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u74f6\u9888\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

I present a preprocessing method for inferring additional cumulative constraints that capture such interactions without search-time probing. This approach interprets cumulative constraints as linear inequalities over occupancy vectors and generates valid inequalities by (i) discovering covers, the sets of tasks that cannot run in parallel, (ii) strengthening the cover inequalities for the discovered sets with lifting, and (iii) injecting the resulting constraints back into the scheduling problem instance. Experiments on standard RCPSP and RCPSP/max test suites show that these inferred constraints improve search performance and tighten objective bounds on favorable instances, while incurring little degradation on unfavorable ones.

However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations.

We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates. On our proposed Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic personality adaptation, we achieve up to 91% win rates across diverse model families.

Existing methods improve reasoning by expanding token-level search through chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, or reinforcement learning, but they leave the model's latent representation space fixed. When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks.

Existing approaches, such as belief state estimation and inter-agent communication, often fall short. Belief-based methods are limited by their focus on past experiences without fully leveraging global information, while communication methods often lack a robust model to effectively utilize the auxiliary information they provide. To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded.

However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations.

Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics.
